----> we are going to analyse the pose of the person using mediapipe opencv.
----->for pose detection using mediapipe.pose
----->create a requiremnt.txt and install all libaries
------> create a conda environment as venev
------>create a main.ipynb to create the model

------>import all the libaries in the main.ipynb file and create the function for detection as for standing walking etc.calculating the angle using the numpy . use opencv and mediapipe to open 
the camera and exxtracting the landamrks in the image.








------> Analyse the maintenence of the class room ie the class room is clean messy dirty etc.
------> Add the requiremnt in requirement.txt file such as tensorflow sciktit-learn etc
------> We are going to use the ANN model to analyse this.

















----------------------->Real Time Speech Sentiment Dectection--------------------------->

------> We are going to use NLP (Natural Processing Language) with the python libaries Speech SpeechRecognition and pyaudio.
----->Going to do Text Preprossing by the libarie nltk and TextBlob for the sentiment analyse.
----->create a function to get the audio by microphone and use google to convert the speech into the text.
----->sentiment give two value Polarity and subjectivity.
---->Polarity tells how much positive or negitive the comment or sppech is (ranges from -1 to 1)
---->Subjective tells weather the speech is Public Opinion or Factual information(range fron 0 to 1)

----> we are going to use the Polarity here since we want to find how positve or negative the person is speaking.
